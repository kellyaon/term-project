Our Repository
The repository has two Python scripts: horror.py and comedy.py. 
Both scripts were created to analyze movie scripts from their respective genres by creating word clouds as well as common collocations and bigrams.

Horror.py and Comedy.py
Both scripts extract text from the source IMSDB.com. The process it done by first fetching the scripts. 
Then, using the BeautfulSoup library, the script parses the HTML to extract the text for 20 scripts of the respective genre. 
This text is then processed by tokenizing the words and removing stopwords. 
Using the WordCloud library, the scripts create word clouds for the respective genre. 
The bigrams and colocations were collected using the nltk library.  

Requirements to run our scripts:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: “requests”, “bs4” (BeautifulSoup), “nltk”, “matplotlib”
- NLTK data (stopwords, tokenizers, etc.)
